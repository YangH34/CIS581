My script is called script.py.

please insert the name of the image, desired video fps, nr, and nc in line 8 - 11:
    Image = 'mountains.jpg'
    fps = 8
    nr = 3
    nc = 3
    as an example, here the name of the image is 'mountains.jpg'

please make sure the image you want to carve is in the same directory as the script (root directory)
The 'Image' folder is used to store all the intermediate images generated. It has a dummy image in there just to allow
    it to be included in the zip file
the video created will be in the root directory with the name of your image + '_video'

'mountains.jpg' is the image that i used
'mountains.jpg_video.avi' is the video generated
